# Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients-HOG-Explained-and-Code-Example-Notebook
This notebook explains the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and its application in pedestrian detection using OpenCV. It covers HOG concepts, feature extraction, parameter tuning (winStride, padding, scale), and demonstrates non-maximum suppression (NMS) with complete code examples.
